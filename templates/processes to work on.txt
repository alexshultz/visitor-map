For the update_static_data method in the KMLManager class, which is intended to manage the backup and updating of static KML data, your unittests should focus on several key aspects to ensure both functionality and robustness. Here’s a list of things to test for:

Backup Integrity:
Ensure that existing data is correctly backed up before any changes are made to the static data.
Verify that the backup contains all the files expected, and their content remains unaltered.
File Handling:
Test that all relevant files in the directory are processed.
Check for proper handling of files that might be locked or inaccessible during the operation.
Data Merging:
Confirm that data from individual KML files are correctly appended to the static KML file.
Ensure that malformed or empty KML files are handled gracefully, either by ignoring or logging errors without disrupting the process.
Error Handling:
Simulate and test reactions to various file system errors (e.g., permission issues, disk full).
Ensure that exceptions are handled properly without crashing the system and that they provide meaningful error messages.
Post-Process Verification:
After merging, verify that the static data file contains all expected entries.
Ensure that temporary or processed files are cleaned up appropriately, keeping the environment clean.
Performance:
Test the method’s performance with a large number of files to ensure that it scales well and completes in a reasonable time.
